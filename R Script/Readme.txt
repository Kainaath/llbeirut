This script takes the tabular LLB dataset generated by fulcrum in csv format and turns it into individual yml files for each entry.

What this script does:

Generates the Yaml template and populates it with the data available from the tabular dataset.
Initializes "complete","anonymized","point_focus","rotated" to False
Generates a "revised_id" for each entry, and names the file after it. The initial ID for each entry was a long randomized string generated by Fulcrunm.
Anonymizes the "created_by" by assigning a number for each of the contributing members in the data collection phase.
Initializes "dominant_language" and "dominant_script" to null.
Creates the "material" field in the header.
Generates a template for the "Body" of the Yaml file, to streamline the transcription process.
