# Transforming our tabular data into YAML

The script llbtransformv0.5.r takes the tabular LLB dataset exported by [Fulcrum](http://www.fulcrumapp.com/) in csv format and turns it into individual .yml files. Each sample image in the project is described by an individual file.


### What this script does:

* Generates the Yaml template and populates it with the data available from the tabular data.
* Sets defaults of "complete", "anonymized", "point_focus", "rotated" to False
* Generates a unique "revised_id" for each entry, and names the file after it. The initial ID for each entry was a long randomized string generated by the app.
* Anonymizes the data, by assigning a number to the "created_by" corresponding to each of the [contributing members](http://llb.djwrisley.com/?page_id=27) in the data collection phase.
* Initializes "dominant_language" and "dominant_script" to null.
* Creates the "material" field in the header.
* Generates an empty template for the "Body" of the Yaml file, to streamline the transcription process.
